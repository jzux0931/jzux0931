## About Me

I’m a developer in continuous growth, currently completing a **Master’s in Full-Stack Development**
with specialization in **Cybersecurity**.

My focus is not on theory alone, but on **building, breaking, and improving systems**:
understanding how software behaves in real environments, writing clean and maintainable code,
and automating processes that reduce risk, errors, and manual work.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming**
  - Python (secure coding practices, OOP)
  - Bash (system automation)

- **Security & Reliability**
  - Input validation
  - Exception-driven control flow
  - Risk-oriented logic design

- **Systems**
  - Linux user & permission models
  - Process management
  - Virtualized environments (WSL, VirtualBox)

- **Development Practices**
  - Git-based workflows
  - Test-driven validation (Pytest)
  - Maintainable and auditable code

---

## What I Build

- Security-oriented tools that analyze users, permissions, and risk scenarios  
- Automation systems for data cleaning, validation, and structured reporting  
- Algorithmic solutions focused on clarity, correctness, and scalability  

---

## Currently Learning

- Advanced Python: exceptions, abstractions, design patterns  
- Linux internals: permissions, processes, system behavior  
- Git workflows: branching, merges, and conflict resolution  
- Automation for security, HR, and finance-related domains  
- Writing code that is testable, maintainable, and resilient  

---

## Mindset

I prioritize long-term skill building over shortcuts,
deep understanding over surface-level knowledge,
and systems that scale over one-off solutions.
